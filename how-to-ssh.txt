Let's try generating the SSH key pair again and ensure it is saved in the correct location:
Open a terminal on your Linux system.Run the following command to generate a new SSH key:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Replace "your_email@example.com" with your email address associated with your GitHub account.

Go to your GitHub account settings:

    Click on "SSH and GPG keys."
    Click on "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key."
    Paste the copied public key into the "Key" field.
    Give your key a descriptive title.
    Click "Add SSH key."

# Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add SSH Key to SSH Agent:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa with the path to your private key if it's located elsewhere.

# error: src refspec main does not match any
likely because the branch hasn't been created or doesn't exist locally.

# You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access
This message is expected and does not indicate an error. It simply means that your SSH connection was authenticated, but GitHub doesn't allow interactive shell access over SSH.

Permissions on SSH Files:
Ensure that the permissions on your SSH files (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub) are set correctly. They should only be readable and writable by you:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

ssh url set :
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git

Test your SSH connection to GitHub directly using the ssh command:
ssh -T git@github.com

Verify SSH Agent:
If you're using an SSH agent, make sure your SSH key is added to the agent:
ssh-add -l

If your key is not listed, add it to the agent:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
