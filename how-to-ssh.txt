Let's try generating the SSH key pair again and ensure it is saved in the correct location:
Open a terminal on your Linux system.Run the following command to generate a new SSH key:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Replace "your_email@example.com" with your email address associated with your GitHub account.

Go to your GitHub account settings:

    Click on "SSH and GPG keys."
    Click on "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key."
    Paste the copied public key into the "Key" field.
    Give your key a descriptive title.
    Click "Add SSH key."

# Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add SSH Key to SSH Agent:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa with the path to your private key if it's located elsewhere.

# error: src refspec main does not match any
likely because the branch hasn't been created or doesn't exist locally.

# You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access
This message is expected and does not indicate an error. It simply means that your SSH connection was authenticated, but GitHub doesn't allow interactive shell access over SSH.

Permissions on SSH Files:
Ensure that the permissions on your SSH files (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub) are set correctly. They should only be readable and writable by you:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

ssh url set :
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git

Test your SSH connection to GitHub directly using the ssh command:
ssh -T git@github.com

Verify SSH Agent:
If you're using an SSH agent, make sure your SSH key is added to the agent:
ssh-add -l

If your key is not listed, add it to the agent:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs

The error message "! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)" indicates that the remote repository contains commits that you don't have locally, and Git is rejecting the push to prevent you from overwriting commits on the remote repository

git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
git commit -m "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master'"
git push origin master


If you've set the upstream branch for your local branch to master, you can use git fetch followed by git merge to fetch and integrate changes from the remote master branch into your local master branch.
git fetch
git merge
git pull - you can use git pull, which combines the git fetch and git merge commands into a single command

fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
The error message "fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches" occurs when Git encounters divergent changes between your local branch and the remote branch, and it's not sure how to reconcile those differences automatically.

You can specify a merge strategy to reconcile the divergent branches. For example, you can choose to perform a merge commit or rebase your changes onto the remote branch.
git pull origin master --no-rebase #to perform a merge commit
To rebase your changes onto the remote branch:
git pull --rebase origin master

If you want to discard your local changes and make your local branch identical to the remote branch, you can reset your branch to the remote branch's state:
git reset --hard origin/master
This command will reset your local master branch to match the master branch on the remote repository. Be cautious with this command as it will discard any local changes that haven't been committed.
